# Optimization_and_Metaheuristics

This repository contains Optimization and Metaheuristics projects 

**Project 1: Local search algorithm**

In project 1, several local search algorithms are provided to solve a knapsack problem. The local search algorithms that I implemented are Simulated Annealing, Variable neighborhood search, Tabu search.

**Project 2: Genetic algorithm**

In project 2, I utilize genetic algorithm to solve Schwefel problem.
